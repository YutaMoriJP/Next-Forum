Forum like web app built with Next.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Still work in progress. User login option (and maybe guest login) will be added, allowing users to edit/delete their posts, respond to other users in comment section with up/downvote feature, sorting option for comments and homepage posts, pagination, better typing for TypeScript etc.
