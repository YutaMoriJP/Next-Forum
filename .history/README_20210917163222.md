Current [Demo](https://next-forum.netlify.app/).

Forum like web app built with Next.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Still work in progress. User login option (and maybe guest login) will be added, allowing users to edit/delete their posts, respond to other users in comment section with up/downvote feature etc.
